    title: "Pizza Marinara",
    description:
      "Pizza marinara is a traditional Neapolitan-style pizza that's simple yet flavorful. It's a classic Italian pizza topped with a few key ingredients: a tomato-based sauce (usually made with tomatoes, garlic, oregano, and olive oil), garlic, oregano, and sometimes a sprinkle of fresh basil. Unlike other pizzas, it typically doesn't contain cheese or any meat toppings. The emphasis is on the fresh, high-quality ingredients and the harmony of flavors between the tangy tomato sauce, aromatic garlic, and fragrant oregano.",

Typically, it starts with a pizza crust, which can be traditional or a variation like a thin-crust or a thicker, chewier base. Instead of the traditional tomato sauce, a generous layer of barbecue sauce is spread over the crust, imparting a sweet, savory, and slightly tangy flavor.",
